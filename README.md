# Autoparts
A lightweight, AI-assisted tool that turns single or multiple Python scripts into an installable package. Plan module layout build the package, and download a ZIPâ€”all from modern web UI. FastAPI powers the backend; Vite/React/Tailwind power the frontend. Optional Ollama/OpenAI naming and safe edits. Works locally, deployable and developer-friendly.
